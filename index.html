                <h3>Grand Theft Auto 5</h3>
                <span>This is one of the best games to ever release on console and is still be played by millions of people around the world
                    a decade after release. For me the second most anticipated game when I was in secondary school.

                <h3>The Last Of Us</h3>
                <span>For me, this is the greatest story mode game of all time. It has action, horror, thriller and a bit of comedy all mixed in together
                    and the attatchment you feel to the characters are so strong. I played this game countless times and it is no suprise why there is 
                    a HBO show about this game.

                <h3>God Of War</h3>
                <span>This game dives into the world of Norse mythology and full of combat. You fight mythical characters and creatures 
                    and travel through lands to complete objectives. I did not play the first 3 but this game did not require it as it
                    referenced the past story lines

                <h3>The Last Of Us Part II</h3>
                <span>Now this game for me is numero uno. When it was announced in 2016, all I could think about is this game due to the first
                    one and god knows how many times I rewatched the announcement trailer. The gameplay and story is unmatched and I've yet to 
                    play anything better.

                <h3>God Of War Ragnarok</h3>
                <span>This is the first story mode game I played on the Playstation 5 and playing on a 4k monitor was just on a whole
                    different experience. The combat and some of the cut scenes felt surreal and the story was immersive.

                <h3>Red Dead Redemption 2</h3>
                <span>This game had me on a chokehold for a longtime. Besides The Last Of Us, I've not been emotionally invested in a 
                    game antagonist like this one. The story was very long but it didn't feel that way and it's just comforting playing
                    in a world set in 1800's America.

                <h3>Uncharted 4</h3>
                <span>I didn't get a chance to play the first 3 Uncharted games but did watch some playthroughs on YouTube but the 4th
                    game released on Playstation 4. Another action packed story and great combat.

                <h3>Batman Arkham Asylum</h3>
                <span>This was the first ever <i>story</i> game I played on console. Picked it up for Â£20 from grainger games down at my
                local market and was hooked. For a playstation 3 game, it had great graphics and there's just something about playing a superhero
                game as a kid.</span>
